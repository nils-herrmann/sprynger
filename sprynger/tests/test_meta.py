        abstract='Purpose (i) Characterize ultra-processed food (UPF) intakes in toddlerhood and mid-childhood, including identifying principal UPF sub-groups and associations with nutrient profile; (ii) explore stability and change in UPF intake between toddlerhood and mid-childhood. Methods Data were from children in the UK Gemini twin cohort at 21 months ( n \u2009=\u20092,591) and 7 years ( n \u2009=\u2009592) of age. UPF intakes were estimated using diet diaries and Nova classification. Complex samples general linear or logistic regression models were used to explore associations between UPF intake, UPF sub-groups and nutrients, and changes in intake over time. Results The contribution of UPF to total energy was 46.9% (±\u200914.7) at 21 months and 59.4% (±\u200912.5) at 7 years. Principal UPF sub-groups were yogurts, higher-fiber breakfast cereals, and wholegrain breads in toddlerhood, and puddings and sweet cereal products and white breads in mid-childhood. At both ages, mean free sugar and sodium intakes exceeded recommended maximums and higher UPF consumption was associated with consuming more of each nutrient ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). UPF intake was negatively associated with fat, saturated fat and protein intake in toddlerhood, and fiber intake in mid-childhood ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). Being in the highest UPF intake quintile in toddlerhood was predictive of being in the highest quintile in mid-childhood (OR 9.40, 95%CI 3.94–22.46). Conclusions UPF accounted for nearly half of toddlers’ energy, increasing to 59% in mid-childhood. Higher UPF consumers had higher intakes of free sugar and sodium. UPF intake in toddlerhood was predictive of mid-childhood intake. Effective policies are needed to reduce UPF intakes in the early years.',
