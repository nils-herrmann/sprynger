The methods based on machine learning include those based on behavior and statistics, whose main idea is to extract the features of the network's traffic and then use traffic features for modeling and training to obtain a classification model that can identify and classify the new traffic in real-time, which has relatively low complexity and good performance, but still has some shortcomings, mainly reflected in:The normal traffic data is more than abnormal traffic for the training sample, and the data imbalance problem will lead to low precision.Most studies emphasize the model's precision in the data set while neglecting to pay attention to the detection rate of the minority attack categories. However, the attacks of the minority categories often cause more damage to the network than the majority categories' attacks.Deep learning [4] is an effective method to solve the shortcomings of shallow machine learning networks. The CNN and RNN have been widely used in classification problems [5] and regression problems [6]. Some methods based on RNN can learn temporal sequence features, but serial-based sequence training has low convergence efficiency and low accuracy.Some machine learning, such as Random Forest (RF) and Decision tree (DT), only learn shallow features, whose effect of multiple classification precision is not good. Deep learning, such as CNN and RNN, made some achievements, but for some large datasets, the generalization ability is poor and can not be calculated in parallel.")
